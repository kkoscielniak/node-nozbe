## What?
`node-nozbe` is a third-party NodeJS implementation of Nozbe REST API.

It partially implements functionality of the Nozbe REST API available [here](https://webapp.nozbe.com/api).

Basically this package is a proof of concept, cool for creating small utilities for Nozbe, without providing the fully-featured set of Nozbe functionalities. If you need something richer, please contact Nozbe support and discuss the idea with them.

## Why? 

The package's sole purpose was to serve as a playground for learning the package development process itself. It was never meant to cover all the aspects of the API as I do not need them. However, if you are willing to expand its possibilities, feel free to open a [Pull Request or an Issue](https://github.com/kkoscielniak/node-nozbe).
